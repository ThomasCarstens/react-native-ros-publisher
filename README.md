# react-native-ros-publisher 
Currently experimenting with the **distributed networking of native sensors.**
Tools: React Native, and ROS Noetic with rosbridge_suite to communicate JSON data to ROS.

**Why?** I want to send phone sensor data to my laptop using ROS.
As of May 2022, this seem to be no other ROS-enabled native framework.
This repo has the basic functionality which I tested on my phone.

## Master branch: Template of basic functionality.

Snapshot of my phone screen (Android): Connects to ros and prints topics. 


## Dev branch: Testing a ROS publisher of Android streamed data.
Star for updates.
