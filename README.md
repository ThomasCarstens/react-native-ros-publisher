## react-native-ros-publisher 
Currently experimenting with distributed networking of native sensors.
_Why?_ This seems to be the first ROS-enabled native framework (as far as my googling tells me, as of May 2022)

### Master branch: Template of basic functionality.
![connect to ros and print topics](/assets/connected.jpeg =200x200 "Connects and Reads Network Topics.").

=> React Native connects to ros and prints topics.

### Dev branch: Testing a ROS publisher of Android streamed data.
Star for updates.
